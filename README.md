## PCB

Kicad files are made with version 8. 

They can be produced at ![PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/). Upload the `MaimaiLed.kicad_pcb.zip` file into the "Quick Order" tool, then keep default settings, that's all.

Even simpler, have a look at the ![published project](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Maimai_LED_ILM_R1_remake_5d1a5d3f.html).
